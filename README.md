# musician-life

> This program uses object oriented programming to outline various
> aspects of my daily life as a musician. It uses a random number generator to
> generate numbers between 1 and 9 which are assigned to hours practiced in a
> week. If I practice 2 hours or less, I do not get to play a weekend gig. If
> I practice between 3 and 6 hours, I get to play a bar gig and make $150. If I
> practice 6 hours or more, I get to play the local auditorium and make $500.
